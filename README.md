# ðŸ“Š TV Energy Consumption Data Story

## 1. Introduction
We are analyzing TV models available in Australia.  
The goal is to understand:  
- Which screen technologies and sizes are most common  
- Which brands offer the most variety  
- How power consumption relates to technology, screen size, and star rating  

This will help consumers and stakeholders make informed decisions about energy-efficient TVs.

## 4. Brands (Q3)
**Finding:**  
- The dataset shows that **BAUHN has the largest number of TV models**, followed by **JVC** and **BLAUPUNKT**.  
- Other brands such as EKO, LOEWE, and AIWA also contribute several models, while many smaller brands have only a few.  

**Insights:**  
- **Bar chart:** Highlights that the market is not dominated by global giants like Samsung or LG in this dataset, but instead by BAUHN, JVC, and BLAUPUNKT.
- <img width="600" height="700" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-01 163913" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48c47864-1fbf-4e8e-88d9-5c4bc8a305b1" />

 
**Story:**  
This suggests that in the Australian market, many lesser-known or local brands have a strong presence in terms of product variety. Consumers may encounter a wider range of models from BAUHN, JVC, and BLAUPUNKT when shopping for TVs.

## 5. Conclusion
From the analysis, we can draw three key insights:  

1. **LCD(LED) is the most common technology** and also the **most energy-efficient**.  
2. **TVs with larger screens consume more power**, but efficiency ratings (star ratings) can offset this.  
3. **BAUHN, JVC, and BLAUPUNKT lead the market** in terms of the number of available models, while many global brands are less represented in this dataset.  

**Takeaway for consumers:**  
Choose a TV by balancing **screen size, technology type (LCD(LED)), and star rating** to minimize energy use and costs.
