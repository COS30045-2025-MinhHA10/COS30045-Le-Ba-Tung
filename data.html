    <h1>üìä TV Energy Consumption Data Story</h1>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      We are analyzing TV models available in Australia.  
      The goal is to understand:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Which screen technologies and sizes are most common</li>
      <li>Which brands offer the most variety</li>
      <li>How power consumption relates to technology, screen size, and star rating</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This will help consumers and stakeholders make informed decisions about energy-efficient TVs.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Screen Technologies (Q1 & Q4)</h2>
    <p><strong>Finding:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The dataset includes three main technologies: <strong>LCD</strong>, <strong>OLED</strong>, and <strong>LCD(LED)</strong>.</li>
      <li>Among them, <strong>LCD(LED) is the most common technology</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Insights:</strong></p>
    <p>üìà Pie Chart ‚Äî LCD(LED) dominates the market share.</p>

    <p>üìä Bar Chart ‚Äî LCD(LED) also consumes the <strong>least amount of power</strong> compared to OLED and LCD.</p>

    <p><strong>Story:</strong> Consumers prefer LCD(LED) not only because it is the most widely available, but also because it offers the lowest power consumption.</p>

    <h2>3. Screen Sizes (Q2, Q5 & Q6)</h2>
    <p><strong>Finding:</strong> The most common screen sizes range between <strong>40‚Äì55 inches</strong>.</p>

    <p><strong>Insights:</strong></p>
    <p>üìä Bar Chart ‚Äî Frequency of screen sizes.</p>
    <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bbce6324-ad7d-4852-b5d6-f8f3f289845f" alt="Bar chart showing frequency of screen sizes">

    <p>üîç Scatter Plot ‚Äî Larger TVs generally consume more power.</p>

    <p>‚≠ê Scatter Plot with Star Ratings ‚Äî Some larger TVs with higher star ratings are more efficient than smaller, poorly rated TVs.</p>
    <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f8f6263-675f-415d-aede-430734ee75d7" alt="Scatter plot showing star rating vs energy efficiency">

    <p><strong>Story:</strong> Size matters, but choosing a TV with a high star rating can significantly reduce energy consumption.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>4. Brands (Q3)</h2>
    <p><strong>Finding:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>BAUHN</strong> has the largest number of TV models, followed by <strong>JVC</strong> and <strong>BLAUPUNKT</strong>.</li>
      <li>Other brands such as EKO, LOEWE, and AIWA also contribute several models, while many smaller brands have only a few.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Insights:</strong></p>
    <p>üìä Bar Chart ‚Äî The market is not dominated by global giants like Samsung or LG in this dataset, but instead by BAUHN, JVC, and BLAUPUNKT.</p>
    <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48c47864-1fbf-4e8e-88d9-5c4bc8a305b1" alt="Bar chart showing number of models by brand">

    <p><strong>Story:</strong> This suggests that in the Australian market, many lesser-known or local brands have a strong presence in terms of product variety. Consumers may encounter a wider range of models from BAUHN, JVC, and BLAUPUNKT when shopping for TVs.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>5. Conclusion</h2>
    <p>From the analysis, we can draw three key insights:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>LCD(LED) is the most common technology</strong> and also the <strong>most energy-efficient</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>TVs with larger screens consume more power</strong>, but efficiency ratings (star ratings) can offset this.</li>
      <li><strong>BAUHN, JVC, and BLAUPUNKT lead the market</strong> in terms of the number of available models, while many global brands are less represented in this dataset.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Takeaway for consumers:</strong> Choose a TV by balancing <strong>screen size</strong>, <strong>technology type (LCD(LED))</strong>, and <strong>star rating</strong> to minimize energy use and costs.</p>
